This repository contains my submission for the project requirement of EE 298F Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

## Project Details

I decided to join the Kaggle Challenge: *Dog Breed Identification*. It requires to identify the breed of the dog in the image.

The challenge here is that there are 120 classes of dogs but the provided training data is only 10222 images.

*Dataset*

The dataset is based on the Stanford dataset. It contains 10222 images of size 224 x 224.
